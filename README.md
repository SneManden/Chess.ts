My little chess game experiment. After watching the excellent mini series
Queens Gambit I couldn't resist the temptation to try and implement chess.
I could dream of (if I ever get that far...) implement some basic neural
networks and maybe train a Chess AI.

## TODO
1. Implement move "Castling"
2. Implement move "En pessant" (when a pawn reaches back rank => exchange with choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight)
3. Check Move validity (own king must not be check by move)
4. Show taken pieces
5. Redo Position constructor to take arguments as (col, row) instead of (row, col)
6. Allow for human to play
7. Graphics
